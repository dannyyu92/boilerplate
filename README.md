Personal Boilerplate App
================================

Decided to make a boilerplate rails app so that I wouldn't have to constantly remake my .gitignore, static pages, etc.

It includes (so far)
-------------------------

* Personal Gemfile
* Personal .gitignore
* 'high_voltage' static pages
* 'quiet_assets'
* Google Maps
